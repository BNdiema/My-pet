  <h2>My Friend's Pet</h2>
  <h3>Cinermon The Hunter</h3>
  <p>Personly am not a pet person, sence am always traveling which meaning
    if i had one they would stearve to death, like the Nairobi City Councel cats
    who are staving at the moment sence there are no kenyans on the streets who
    would occationaly throw a bone to them after "munching" on all the meat and leaving
    just abone. Have you ever tested those KFC drum sticks" belive me they are
    finger leaking good. And if it happend to land on one of our Luya frien's mouth,
    you wont be seeing any bones.
  <p/>

  <p>Enogh about staving "kanjo" pets and Luyas with chicken bones. Back to
    Cinermon, she is some what of a wired dog she has a fetish of
    <ul>
      <li>feet</li>
      <li>face</li>
    </ul>
